I went back and looked at my Tetris code and thought it could be so much better. So i ended up reading a bit more on different algorithms and came with the idea that i could make a engine were different algorithms could be injected, and at the same time use it headless and within unity.

It contains all basic rules, with rules similar to the gameboy version.
