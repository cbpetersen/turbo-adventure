My Remake of the legendary arcade game, I added a much higher pace than the original to enhance the action.

You control with ← → and fire the laser cannon with Space key.

You can go full-screen by right-clicking on the game to maximize the gaming experience.

Hope you will enjoy, and ill buy beer for the top ranked :-)

I made a small fix 8/7 13:00, so you might have to close your browser or clear your cache to be able to get the new version, otherwise you can't get on the High score list. if you played the game before this this time
if it says error while loading the game, try refresh the page, it seems to help.

Note, after my web server change the high score is broken, as i haven't put up a web service and database for the high score list
